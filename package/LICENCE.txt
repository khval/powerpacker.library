powerpacker.library for AmigaOS4.1 2022 is written by Kjetil Hvalstrand 
and is based on libraries distributed as Public domain that is based on 
Nico Francois work.

This product is distributed under the Public domain.

pplib 1.2: a simple PowerPacker decompression and decryption library
placed in the Public Domain on 25-Nov-2010 by Stuart Caie.
 
Powerpack command is based on pplib 1.0 source code from Stuart Caie placed in Public Domain in 18.09.2003.
ppcrack was also based on pplib but released in 2010, the code is simular.

PowerPacker Version 37.8 was created by Kev Harrison (1996-2001), without any Licence info.
The V37.8 version only contains the library and readme file, autodocs and original header files are missing.
The readme has few words about "Nico Francois".
Quote: "As Nico hasn't updated powerpacker for several years, and has given reqtools
to someone else, Is it safe to say, that he's left the Amiga."

Powerpacker.library V36
Freely distributable, but are also Copyright (c) Nico Franuois.
Quote: "Example.c, example.asm and Example.mod are full public domain and can be used in any way you like :-)"

Quote: "There is one exception to the above. If your program is freely distributable and 
uses powerpacker.library you have permission to include powerpacker.library with your distribution. 
Your program's documentation should state that your program uses powerpacker.library and that the library
is Copyright (c) Nico Franuois."

The conclusion you can draw from this is that some parts are Public Domain, other parts are not 
unless Nico Franuois, writes a written statement that's no longer is true, some things like documentation, 
C libs for Dice, Manx-C, Oberon, SAS-C, reqtools.library and so on can't be included. 
If you want write code for 680x0 amiga you most download V36 from aminet (pplib16-1.lha).
