This software was released as freely distributale, in commercial or none commercial software,
without changed to files on PP V36.10 version (1991-1993)..

version 37.8 was created by Kev Harrison (1996-2001), without any Licence info.
but in the read me it says "Nico" left the Amiga, it does not say how Kev got the source code.
that part is a bit unclear,

But we know machine code was also linked into Amiga executable files, distributed with different licenses.
this was part of feature of the software, today this kind of software is distributed under LGPL, or MIT,
Apache License maybe, back then everything was Public Domain or Commercial, all the diffence License came later.
