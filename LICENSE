Copyright (c) 1993 Nico Francois

This software was released as freely distributale, in commercial or none commercial software,
without changed to files on PP V36.10 version (1991-1993)..

Version 37.8 was created by Kev Harrison (1996-2001), without any Licence info.
but in the read me it says "Nico" left the Amiga, it does not say how Kev got the source code.
that part is a bit unclear,

Powerpack command is based on pplib 1.0 source code from Stuart Caie placed in Public Domain in 18.09.2003.
ppcrack was also based on pplib but released in 2010, the code is simular.
